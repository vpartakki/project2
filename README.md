# Project 2 for Interactive Digital Multimedia - ARS361

a project with *p5js* 

***


## Concept:
*Paraphrasing the Object Orientation essay*

“The goal of software engineering is to produce unambiguous software that masters complexity [using] abstractions [that] are simplified descriptions with a limited number of accepted properties.”

Make a piece in which you abstract something in software that cannot be abstracted.

## Inspiration:

When you set out for Ithaka
ask that your way be long,
full of adventure, full of instruction.
...
And if you find her poor, Ithaka hasn't deceived you.
So wise you have become, of such experience,
that already you'll have understood what these Ithakas mean.
